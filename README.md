# Interactive Shopping List

This project is a code challenge that combines array iteration, DOM manipulation, and event handling to create an interactive shopping list application.

## Objective

Develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

## Requirements

## Array

Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

## DOM Manipulation

Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes.)
Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).

## Event Handling

Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

## Bonus Features

Allow users to edit existing list items.
Implement persistence using local storage to save the list even after the page reloads.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will practice iterating through an array to access and manipulate list items.
They will gain experience dynamically modifying the DOM based on user interaction.
The challenge reinforces understanding of event listeners and their use in creating interactive applications.

# How to Use

### Adding Items:

Enter an item in the input field and click the "Add" button. The item will be added to the list.

### Marking Items as Purchased:

Click on an item in the list to mark it as purchased. The item will be visually updated to indicate it has been purchased.

### Clearing the List:

Click the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

### Editing Items (Bonus Feature):

Double-click an item to edit its content. Press Enter to save the changes.

### Persistent List (Bonus Feature):

The list will be saved in the browser's local storage and will persist even after the page is reloaded.
